Best practices in KiCad 6 — Sheet configuration and hierarchy
This article discusses a proposal for a sheet hierarchy used in KiCad 6 in order to make the schematic cleaner, more “printable” and modular.

It is important to point out that what is being presented is a “proposal” and not the “correct way” of working with hierarchical sheets in KiCad.

The initial idea is that the user can use A4 sheet sizes, with a standardized header. The first sheet is the main one, and in this there are no components, only other hierarchical sheets representing the modules and the connections established between them.

Soon I'll add a PCB file in this repository to give directions of how to prepare your board to manufacture!
